## 🤔 Why?

Because:
- I wanted to track my progress without lifting a finger
- Coding interviews are hard enough — automation helps
- Solving problems is fun, but pushing commits isn’t

## 🛠️ Automation

This repo uses:

- [`solved.ac`](https://solved.ac/) API for BOJ problem count
- [`leetcode-stats-api`](https://leetcode-stats-api.herokuapp.com/) for LeetCode problem count
- A custom Python script in [`scripts/update_readme.py`](scripts/update_readme.py)
- A GitHub Actions workflow scheduled to run every day
